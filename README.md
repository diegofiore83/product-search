# Product Exercise

Evaluate problem solving with React + TS, API data, search UX, and performance.

## Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- React Router
- React Query
- Material UI

## Run it

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## What's already there

Base product card grid loaded and displayed from https://dummyjson.com/products?limit=100

## Goal

Add a product search to the existing Products page so users can quickly find items. Do it in a way that minimizes API calls and avoids unnecessary re-renders.
The search functionality is available here: https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q={string}&limit=${number}
